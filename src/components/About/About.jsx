                            The Kinglet Brass Card is a new type of credit/debit card for
                            the 21st century
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            Made from durable brass, it can replace any plastic card that
                            you might have in your wallet today. A metal credit or debit
                            card is a type of plastic card that has been reinforced with a
                            metal core. This makes the card more durable and less likely to
                            bend or break. Metal cards also have a more luxurious feel than
                            standard plastic cards. Skincardz offers a custom metal credit
                            or debit card that can be personalized with your own design We
                            offer a custom engraving service to upgrade plastic debit-credit
                            cards to metal by engraving personal designs.

                            6210 Watford Dr League City, TX 77573 We believe that Kinglet is
                            the best source for high quality metal credit cards. We hope
                            that you will give us a try and see for yourself how we can help

                            Why is Kinglet better than walking around with your card in
                            plastic?
                        </h2>
                        <p>
                            1. Your card information can be copied by disgruntled employees,
                            so metal credit cards are safer with engraved letters and
                            numbers. 2. Our black oxide stainless steel cards are the
                            highest quality and one of the heaviest in the world. According
                            to our initial research, they are the only high-quality
                            stainless steel cards on the market. 3. With the introduction of
                            new cards, clients have the option to omit card number
                            information for safety. Production will begin with 8 or 5
                            numbers, but during transactions the middle cards won't have
                            their numbers engraved, so the cards can be functional in public
                            without jeopardizing your card information.

                        <h2>Why Use a Metal Credit/Debit Card?</h2>
                        <p>
                            There are several reasons why you might want to use a metal
                            credit/debit card. A metal card can be more durable than a
                            plastic card, so it is less likely to be damaged. Metal cards
                            also have a more luxurious look and feel than plastic cards.
                            They can also be better at resisting wear and tear, so they can
                            last longer than plastic cards. Overall, there are many good
                            reasons like having a customized or pre-made design on your
                            card.
