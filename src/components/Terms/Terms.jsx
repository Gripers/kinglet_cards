              card company that is acceptable to us. We have the right to refuse

              occasionally another party). Where there is a contract made with
              another party, we are not acting as either an agent or principal
              and the contract is made between yourself and that third party and
              will be subject to their terms of sale which they supply you. When
              placing an order, you agree for us to use the credit or debit card

              order cost. Foreign products and services may fluctuate in price
              as determined by local or international government agencies or
              banks. All prices advertised on our website are subject to such
              changes.

              perform their own identity verification.
